## Exercise 1/2: Tutorial 

I followed the tutorial of the book Meteor Starters Guide. Everything went very well, although i noticed that the tutorial is a little bit outdated. 

## Exercise 3/4: App and database

My first idea was based on the fact that group of friends always predict game results, no matter what the game is about. Many friends of mine play football and have a lot of discussions about what the results of the games will be. Therefore i wanted to make an app where friends can predict games and watch the scores realtime. Because im not that interested in football i decided to use the game [League of Legends](http://leagueoflegends.com/) as theme.  

League of Legends has a comprehensive api reference. There are a lot of api's available and all the function's are well documented. You can find all the api's [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods).

Details:  
* 10 requests every 10 seconds
* 500 requests every 10 minutes
* Real time data of a game
* A summonerId is needed to watch (spectate) a live game

####Concept

The idea of the concept is that friends can discuss and predict score's about a match. When the match begins, the users can see live updated statistics about the game. 

####MVP Features
* User can make a group for friends
* Users can invite eachother to their group
* Users can predict the game score
* Users can choose a game to see
* Users can see live updates from the game

#### Additional features
* Live chat during the game
