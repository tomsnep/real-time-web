## Exercise 1/2: Tutorial 

I followed the tutorial of the book Meteor Starters Guide. Everything went very well, although i noticed that the tutorial is a little bit outdated. 

## Exercise 3/4: App and database

The problem i want to tackle is that many times a group of friends don't know from eachother what they are planning to do or where they are in for. The data is generated by the users.

In the app users can make a group for friends where they can add their plans for the weekend. Other users in the group can indicate that they are interested in participating or can indicate that they are already busy at that moment. It is some kind of weekend planner for friends. 

The core features are:  
* The ability to make a group
* The ability to join a group
* The ability to add a activity
* The ability to indicate your interest in a activity
* A summary of tonights activities

Possible future features are:  
* The ability to add a "desire status" (if a user do not have fixed plans already, the user can share the things he is interested in. For example: user 1 want's to drink beer friday night)  
* Calendar integration
